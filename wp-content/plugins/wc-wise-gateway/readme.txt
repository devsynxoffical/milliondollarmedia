A simple WooCommerce payment gateway for Wise (formerly TransferWise)

== Description ==

*Gateway for Wise on WooCommerce* is a simple payment gateway that doesn't rely on API's. Upon placing an order with such method of payment, the bank account details of the seller become available in the thank-you page and emails, so the customer can refer to that data to perform the payment manually using their own online banking, for example.

= Main features =

* Can support an unlimited number of Wise balances/accounts/currencies. The only limitation is they all must have the same person as beneficiary
* Each bank account from Wise configured in the backend gets displayed to the customer only when relevant criteria are met: (a) matches the same currency as an order, or (b) has a scope of usage that includes the billing country itself, or the continent it's located  
* i18n friendly

== Installation ==

Installing *Gateway for Wise on WooCommerce* is similar to any other WP plugin. The installation can be done either by searching the WP plugin repository or via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WP Dashboard.

Upon install and activation, go to "WooCommerce > Settings > Payments", and to the newly added "Wise bank transfer" gateway hit the "Set-up" (or "Manage") button to configure it as per your needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin and for whom is it for? =

*Gateway for Wise on WooCommerce* is a simple Payment Gateway for Wise (formerly TransferWise) that doesn't rely on any API's. For customers that had chosen "bank transfer" as their preferred method of payment, it provides the bank details of the seller that best fits the given transaction. Bank payments via Wise would be preferred by some customers for their lower overall fees, or because they don't fancy other methods like credit cards, paypal or similar services. Also in some countries, like Germany, it's become customary to pay for stuff online via bank transfers.
